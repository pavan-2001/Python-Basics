**OBJECTS**

an object is a data-field that has unique attributes and behavior.

**CLASS**

**class** is like a object-creater, or 'blue print' for creating objects.

To create a class we use **class** keyword.

**Syntax**:

class class_name:
 
Every class has a in-built function : __init__()

this is the constructor of the class.

**CONSTRUCTOR**

It is used to initialize data members of a class.

**SELF**

self is a reference to the current object tha we are working on.

you can use any name for it but self name looks convenient to use.

And most of the programmers use self.

The reference to the object must be te first parameter of the function.

**PASS**

If your class s empty and if you still and you compile your program you will get an error .

If you write the pass statement you will get no errors .
