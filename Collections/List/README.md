Lists can hold values of any Datatype.

We can use append on List to add an element on back.

We can use insert to ad elements in a appropriate position .

We can access the elements of a list by index 

len()- Returns the size of the list

Here in the demo code don't get confused by the name i've given to my list you can use a different one, if you feel it little bit messy
