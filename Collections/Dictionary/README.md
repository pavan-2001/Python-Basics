Dictionaries holds key/value pairs.

We represent Dictionaries by Curly Braces-{}

Key's=={'State_1','State_2','State_3'}

Key-value pairs-

State_1=Hydrabad

State_2=Telangana

State_3=Maharashtra

State_4=Rajasthan

-> we cannot use append or insert to add an item in Dictionary .

-> If we want to add a new key-value pair this is the way you can do that 

  Dictionary_name['Key']='value'
  
->it will add a new element if there is no key in the existing Dictionary with the same key.

else it will change the value of existing key to the new value .

-> You can access elements by their corresponding key.

------------------Note-------------------

append- Is used to add elements at the end of Collections.

insert-Is used to add elements at an apropriate place .

len(Collection name)- Returns an integer which represents the size of a particular collection.
