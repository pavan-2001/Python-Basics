# Reading a file

**If you want to read a file from the same location you need not mention the path of the file.**

**Else you have to mention the path of the file and in the place of single forward slash you have to insert double forwad slash**

**If you want to read only few characters of your file you cant give an integer argument indicating the no. of charaters you want to print.**
